## Release notes

This is a resubmission of the `guardianapi` package. The first version 0.1.0 was
published on CRAN on 2019-02-03. This update switches to a vignette that stores
data locally rather than calling to the external API to reduce HTTP 501 errors
that occured in some automatic checks


## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel)
